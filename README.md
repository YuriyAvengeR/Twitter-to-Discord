### Twitter to Discord

ðŸ“„ Twitter to Discord will allow you to effortlessly send links from Twitter to Discord with previews, just like in the past, using my script and vx proxy. 
Just run the program, and it will work in the tray, converting links from Twitter through the proxy into Discord-friendly links with previews.
The program only responds to links from Twitter, preventing phantom triggers.
