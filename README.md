### Twitter to Discord

📄 Twitter to Discord will allow you to effortlessly send links from Twitter to Discord with previews, just like in the past, using my script and vx proxy. 
Just run the program, and it will work in the tray, converting links from Twitter through the proxy into Discord-friendly links with previews.
The program only responds to links from Twitter, preventing phantom triggers.

🍉 How to use
To run the script, download and execute Twitter to Discord.exe. 
Download it in [releases tab]([Releases](https://github.com/YuriyAvengeR/Twitter-to-Discord/releases/tag/1.0))
After that, a white square will appear in the system tray, indicating that the script is active. To close it, right-click and choose 'Close.'

🍋 **If you prefer not to run my .exe file**
If you consider running my .exe file unsafe, you can create it yourself. 
1. Clone my repository and install the libraries from the requirement.txt file if your IDE didn't do it during cloning. 
2. Enter the following command in the terminal: _pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --name "Twitter to Discord" "path to python file/tray_version.py_ where path to python file is the path to the project folder. For example: _pyinstaller --noconfirm --onefile --windowed --name "Twitter to Discord" "F:/Twittertodiscordl/tray_version.py"_
3. Wait for the creation of the .exe file based on my script, which you can inspect for malicious code before use. After completion, your .exe file will be in the project directory in the 'dist' folder."
